There are two ways to define a scribble. You can add scribbles via the strikethrough icon in the WYSIWYG visual editor(see screenshot). You can also add class "scribble" to the target html element (see screenshot).

= What if I want to keep my strikethroughs and just add scribbles seperarely? =

Uncheck the box at Settings > Scribble > Use Instead of Strikethrough. You will now have to add class "scribble" to the target html scribble element (as the strikethrough icon in WYSIWYG visual editor will result in a normal strikethrough.)
